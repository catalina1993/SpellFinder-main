## 🛠 Tech Stack
-  **React.js** – Frontend framework
-  D&D 5E API – Fetches live spell data

##  Challenges & Lessons Learned
-  API Data Formatting
The API response structure required additional parsing to display spell details correctly.
Some spells had missing attributes, requiring dynamic handling of empty values.
-  UI Responsiveness
The spell filter and results layout needed multiple refinements for desktop and mobile views.
Ensured that spell cards adapt to all screen sizes.
-  Dropdown & Form Styling
Without Bootstrap, we had to custom-style dropdowns, form inputs, and buttons to fit the dark theme.
Focused on accessibility and responsiveness.
-  Performance Optimization
Fetching API data in real time initially caused slow load times.
Optimized caching API requests and reducing re-renders for better performance.
Despite these challenges, team collaboration and problem-solving helped us refine the app into a functional and user-friendly tool.
